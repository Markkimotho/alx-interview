![Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle#/media/File:PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

Pascal's triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers that starts with a 1 at the top. Each number in the triangle is obtained by adding the two numbers directly above it. Here's an example of the first few rows of Pascal's triangle:

In the triangle, each number represents the sum of the two numbers directly above it. For example, in the 4th row, the number 6 is the sum of the two numbers above it (3 + 3).

Pascal's triangle has many interesting properties and is used in various mathematical and combinatorial applications. It helps in understanding and solving problems related to binomial coefficients, probability, and algebraic expressions.
